stream data to cesium. link time series plot to roll, pitch, yaw + location data.
need to emit the time stamp from the plot and use it to drive cesium.

use a non-discript model for the aircraft. (look at paper drone)
(play back location setpoints, like mavcesium)


full screen graphs. with linked axis. zooming in on one plot will do the same with all time series data.
